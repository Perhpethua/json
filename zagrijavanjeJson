    "Sprava_korištenje":"OPIS : Warming up the muscles before training actually belongs to the part of treninga.Ne warm all muscle groups at least five minutes before training is simply unacceptable. Right from the start you have made the cardinal mistake.

It's like when you start the engine of your vehicle at -1 degree Celsius and immediately you add accelerator to the floor. Soon the machine will not work well or not at all. It's the same with your body. All day your body is in most cases used only certain muscles and joints, depending on what business can do. The other is almost not used.

When you come to training in the fitness center you will use all the muscle groups. It is unlikely that you will avoid any muscle. So unused muscle or joint does not have sufficient temperature, ie. Blood supply and therefore no volume trends. When you go to these muscles and joints to perform an exercise, easily cracking or sprains. It was a sudden shock to the muscles and joints, which when the load unaccustomed to such a performance from sleep, suddenly get a load and fail in the short term supply themselves with blood.
No need of heating work or too big bugaboo!
 Do not shoot the muscle just like that. Do not come up with a pulled so easy. No precautions are in any case good and in this case the measure is warming.",
