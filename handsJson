    "Sprava_korištenje":"OPIS :So often, the biceps and triceps are the focal point of upper extremity development, while the forearms and wrists are given minimal attention. But the forearms and wrists allow us to perform the exercises that develop and maximize biceps, triceps, deltoid, chest, and back strength. Therefore, it is imperative that we devote time and energy to optimize the strength of our hands, wrists, and forearms.
 
As an orthopedic surgeon, I speak with many of my athletes and patients about forearm and leg development on a regular basis. Many of them complain about having thin, bird-like legs and forearms. But if you work your legs and forearms, they will respond and develop. We have to do the work and eliminate any excuses such as “my legs are always small” or “my forearms just don’t seem to bulk up.” Do the work and get the results.
Know what hand weights are good for. Keep in mind that hand weights are also called dumbbells or free weights. Exercises that use hand weights are good for building up strength, increasing your endurance, and building muscle mass.",
